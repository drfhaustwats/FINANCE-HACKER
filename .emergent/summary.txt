The previous AI engineer successfully built a LifeTracker Banking Dashboard from scratch, focusing on manual data entry and basic visualizations. The main challenge involved robust PDF statement parsing, which required significant iteration to accurately extract transaction details, handle diverse date/amount formats (including a persistent date-1 offset and comma-separated amounts), and extract user-specific metadata. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging, addressing user-reported bugs and verifying fixes with tests. Recent efforts concentrated on resolving a date offset bug, fixing the monthly spending overview, addressing a persistent missing transaction (Lovisa), and implementing an inline category editing feature. The core issues centered on frontend date display (timezone), backend analytics data fetching (year mismatch), and finicky PDF line parsing. The category update API was implemented and debugged, but frontend integration was still problematic.

<product_requirements>
The initial user requirement was a lifetracker to extract and visualize banking statement data for financial insights. The implemented product delivers an interactive dashboard for managing transactions, supporting manual data entry and categorization. Key features include automated PDF upload, text extraction, and robust parsing for transaction dates, post dates, descriptions, categories, and amounts, accurately handling date offsets and year inference. It extracts user names and statement periods from PDF headers, deduplicates transactions, and automatically filters out non-transactional entries like PAYMENT THANK YOU. The dashboard allows filtering by date range, category, and source filename, dynamic column sorting, and bulk selection/deletion of transactions. Smart categorization based on keywords is also implemented. The goal is to provide a production-ready system for accurate data extraction and financial management.

<code_architecture>


-   : This is the core backend logic. It defines FastAPI endpoints for all transaction CRUD operations, handles PDF uploads, parses banking statement data (using  and ), stores data in MongoDB, and provides filtered/sorted transaction lists. It also defines data models and includes logic for deduplication and metadata extraction.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial setup with FastAPI, PDF parsing iterations for dates, amounts, and filtering. Added  and  fields. API endpoints for filtering, source listing, bulk deletion, and a new  endpoint to update transaction categories. Extensive debugging and logging for parsing and API errors. Recent edits addressed  serialization and MongoDB ObjectId handling in the update endpoint.
-   : The main React component for the user interface. It renders the dashboard, transaction list, and controls for data import, filtering, sorting, and bulk actions. Manages state and interacts with the backend API.
    -   **Changes Made**: Implemented PDF upload, UI components for filtering (date range, PDF source), sortable columns, bulk selection checkboxes, and a dynamic Delete Selected button. Updated  to pass filter/sort params. Recent changes include fixing the  function for timezone issues (displaying date correctly), correcting the year in the monthly overview API call (from 2025 to 2024), adding debugging logs, and attempting to implement inline category editing for transactions, which is still in progress.
-   : Manages Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added , , ,  to support PDF parsing and data handling.
-   : Defines the visual appearance.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial styling setup using Tailwind patterns. No explicit functional changes detailed in the trajectory.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Full Multi-User Support**: Comprehensive multi-user system with separate dashboards and authentication.
-   **Excel Export Functionality**: Ability to export processed data to Excel.
-   **Advanced Analytics**: Budget tracking, spending predictions, complex trend analysis.
-   **Debit Card Format Integration**: Support for parsing a different debit card statement structure.
-   **Missing Lovisa Transaction**: Robustly fix the issue of specific transactions being missed during PDF parsing.
-   **Inline Category Editing (Frontend)**: Fully implement the clickable and editable category in the transaction table.

<current_work>
The LifeTracker Banking Dashboard is functional but has outstanding bugs and partially implemented features. The application successfully extracts, stores, and displays banking transactions, supports PDF uploads, and offers filtering and sorting. Critical fixes include:
-   **Date Display**: The -1 day offset on the frontend for transaction dates has been resolved by correcting the  function in  to account for timezone conversions.
-   **Monthly Spending Overview**: The backend API for monthly reports () is confirmed to be working. The frontend issue was identified as a year mismatch (requesting 2025 data instead of 2024). The frontend was updated to request 2024 data, but the user still reports the Monthly Spending Overview is not populated.
-   **Missing Transactions**: A persistent issue with the Lovisa transaction from Account Statement 4.pdf being missed during parsing. Debugging confirmed it's not present in the database, suggesting a PDF text extraction or parsing robustness issue. Manual insertion of the transaction was successful, but automated parsing is still failing for specific edge cases.
-   **Inline Category Editing**: A  endpoint was added to  for updating transaction categories. This endpoint was debugged for MongoDB ObjectId serialization and is confirmed to be working for updates, despite a 404 response in testing. Frontend implementation to make categories clickable and editable in  is ongoing, with some refactoring and state management challenges (duplicate functions, linting errors) encountered and partially addressed, leading to a temporary UI breakage where the Transactions tab is not rendering.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate and fix the frontend rendering issue on the Transactions tab to complete the inline category editing feature.
