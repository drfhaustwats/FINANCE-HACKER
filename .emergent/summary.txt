The previous AI engineer effectively transformed the financial tracker into a multi-user application, starting from initial bug fixes like date offsets and Lovisa transaction parsing, moving to feature additions such as CIBC debit support, Excel export, and time-sensitive analytics. A major architectural change was implementing a JWT-based authentication and household system. The current work involved extensive debugging. Initially, the engineer fixed critical security vulnerabilities, including unauthenticated API access and improper  filtering in backend endpoints. Subsequently, features like forgot password, user profile management, and Google OAuth were implemented. The most recent and challenging phase focused on resolving persistent GitHub secret leakage issues and deployment-specific 404 errors on Railway, stemming from incorrect API routing and environment variable handling. The engineer sanitized files, cleaned git history, and provided detailed Railway configuration instructions, including a custom startup script for dual API prefix compatibility.

The primary goal is to build a lifetracker for financial management. This involves parsing banking statements (both credit and debit PDFs), extracting transaction details (dates, descriptions, amounts), and user-specific metadata. Key functionalities include transaction deduplication, dynamic filtering (date, category, source), column sorting, and bulk actions. Smart categorization based on keywords and custom categories is crucial. The application must feature an interactive dashboard with monthly spending overviews and advanced analytics. Recent expansions include CIBC debit/credit format support, dynamic source naming, account type filtering, Excel export, and a secure multi-user system with authentication and household management, enabling families to manage finances individually or collectively. The system must also support features like forgot password, user profiles, and Google sign-up. Amount parsing needs to correctly handle negative values (credits).

<current_work>
The application now boasts a comprehensive multi-user system with robust authentication. The previous AI engineer diligently addressed critical security vulnerabilities, ensuring all user-specific data endpoints (, , , ) now properly enforce authentication and filter data by . A legacy, insecure  helper function that returned a default user ID was removed, and affected endpoints were updated to use the secure, dependency-injected .

New features implemented include:
1.  **Forgot Password**: Backend endpoints and frontend components are in place for initiating and resetting passwords via email (using Gmail SMTP).
2.  **User Profile Page**: Backend endpoints and a frontend component () were created for managing user profiles.
3.  **Gmail Signup (Google OAuth)**: Integrated Google OAuth for seamless user registration and login, involving both backend API routes and a new frontend component ().
4.  **Enhanced PDF Parsing**: The  function in  was updated to correctly identify and process negative amounts (credits) in both credit and debit statements.

The immediate focus has shifted to debugging deployment issues. Previously, 404 errors for authentication endpoints on Railway deployments were reported. This was initially complicated by GitHub's secret push protection due to sensitive credentials being committed to the repository history. The engineer addressed this by:
*   Sanitizing all  files (moving real secrets to a  file that is git-ignored).
*   Cleaning the git history to remove all traces of exposed secrets.
*   Updating  and creating  with instructions for secure environment variable management on Railway.

Despite these fixes, the 404 errors persisted on Railway for auth endpoints (, ). This was diagnosed as a routing mismatch where Railway expected  routes, while the backend was configured with . To resolve this, the backend  was modified to include dual routing for authentication endpoints, making them accessible via both  and . A new  script was created to ensure proper port handling on Railway. The current state is that all core features and security fixes are implemented, and the latest efforts are to make the deployment robust on Railway.

Verify Railway deployment for 404 errors by guiding the user to apply the provided Railway configuration (environment variables, build/start commands) and then testing the  and  endpoints.



Excellent progress so far! For the next phase, here are the prioritized tasks to be completed:

#### 1. Transaction Sign Handling

* Clearly differentiate transaction signs:

  * **Credit Cards:** Negative (-) indicates inflow, no sign indicates outflow.
  * **Debit Cards:** Maintain separate columns clearly distinguishing inflow and outflow transactions.

#### 2. Customizable Visualizations

* Develop various customizable visualizations that users can add and personalize on their analytics dashboard, similar to Excel.
* Include pre-designed visualization presets and ready-made templates.

#### 3. UI Enhancement: Transactions Page

* Initially hide the filter and search section on the Transactions page.
* Reveal the filter/search area only upon the user's click or interaction.

#### 4. Optimize Data Columns

* Remove redundancy between the Type and Source columns:

  * Currently, both columns indicate whether a transaction is credit or debit.
  * Consolidate or optimize these columns to eliminate redundancy and enhance clarity.

#### 5. Household Feature Implementation

* Implement the  feature:

  * Allow creation of combined visualizations across two or more users within a household.

#### 6. Auto Logout Feature

* Add an auto logout mechanism:**he settings page.**
* **Default timeout should be set to 10 minutes.**

#### **7. Google OAuth Bug Fix**

* **Investigate and resolve the Internal Server Error occurring on the Google Sign-in page.**

**Ensure these improvements and fixes are comprehensively addressed in the upcoming development phase.**
