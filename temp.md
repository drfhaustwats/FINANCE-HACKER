    message: "Attempted to test the inline category editing functionality but encountered a critical issue: The Transactions tab is not rendering the transaction table in the UI, even though the API is correctly returning transaction data. The API response includes the Lovisa Alberta AB transaction with the correct date (2024-10-13) and amount ($29.39), but the table is not being displayed in the UI. This appears to be a frontend rendering issue that needs to be fixed before we can test the category editing feature. The Monthly Overview section in the Overview tab is working correctly and shows data for September and October 2024."

    message: "Starting Phase 1 investigation. User confirmed category editing is working from their testing. User has provided CIBC credit card statements showing Lovisa transaction missing from parsing. Need to investigate CIBC PDF parsing robustness and ensure all transactions are captured correctly. Focus on improving PDF parsing for CIBC format specifically."
