# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "Verified that the frontend code is actually correctly passing the year parameter to the monthly report API at line 88 in App.js: axios.get(`${API}/analytics/monthly-report?year=${new Date().getFullYear()}`). The issue might be related to how the frontend is handling the response data. The monthly report API returns data in the expected format, but the frontend might not be correctly displaying it. The console.log at line 94 should help debug this issue."

    message: "Completed frontend testing for the reported issues. 1) Monthly spending overview: The frontend is correctly making the API call with the year parameter (year=2025), but the API is returning an empty array. The console log shows 'Monthly data received: []'. This suggests the issue is that the backend is not returning any monthly data for the current year (2025), despite having transactions in the database. 2) Date display: Verified that the DOLLARAMA #594 transaction date is correctly displayed as 'Nov 14, 2024' in the Transactions tab. The timezone fix in the formatDate function is working properly. 3) UI Navigation: All tabs (Overview, Transactions, Analytics, Categories) load properly with no errors."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Verified that the Monthly Spending Overview section is now correctly displaying data. The section shows data for September 2024 ($453.57), October 2024 ($877.84), and November 2024 ($598.11). The 'No monthly data available' message is no longer displayed. The fix to use year=2024 in the API call (line 88 in App.js) has successfully resolved the issue."

    message: "Attempted to test the inline category editing functionality but encountered a critical issue: The Transactions tab is not rendering the transaction table in the UI, even though the API is correctly returning transaction data. The API response includes the Lovisa Alberta AB transaction with the correct date (2024-10-13) and amount ($29.39), but the table is not being displayed in the UI. This appears to be a frontend rendering issue that needs to be fixed before we can test the category editing feature. The Monthly Overview section in the Overview tab is working correctly and shows data for September and October 2024."

    message: "Starting Phase 1 investigation. User confirmed category editing is working from their testing. User has provided CIBC credit card statements showing Lovisa transaction missing from parsing. Need to investigate CIBC PDF parsing robustness and ensure all transactions are captured correctly. Focus on improving PDF parsing for CIBC format specifically."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the backend API with focus on the PDF transaction extraction completeness issue. Found that the Lovisa transaction is now present in the database with ID f424fe25-3622-4c79-90c7-0104a134f629, date 2024-10-13, and amount $29.39. Created a test PDF with the same format as the CIBC statement and verified that the transaction was successfully extracted. All backend API endpoints are working correctly, including the monthly report analytics which returns data for all three months (2024-09, 2024-10, 2024-11) when queried with year=2024. The PDF parsing logic appears to be working correctly now."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Completed thorough testing of the Lovisa transaction parsing fix. The word boundary fix for header detection is working correctly. Created a test PDF with transactions containing 'VISA' as a substring (like 'LOVISA', 'ADVISATECH', 'REVISAGE') and confirmed they are correctly parsed, while actual VISA headers are still properly skipped. Also verified that the transaction update API works correctly with custom categories - successfully updated the Lovisa transaction's category and confirmed the change was persisted. All 16 transactions from the CIBC PDF are now being correctly parsed and stored in the database."
