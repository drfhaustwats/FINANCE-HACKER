# Railway Deployment Fix

The issue you're seeing is that Railway is routing requests to `/auth/*` instead of `/api/auth/*`.

I've added dual routing in the backend to support both patterns:
- `/api/auth/*` - for local development and standard setups
- `/auth/*` - for Railway compatibility

## Current Status:
✅ Backend supports both routing patterns
✅ Should work with Railway now

## If you're still getting 404s, try these Railway settings:

### 1. Railway Build Settings:
- **Build Command:** `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Start Command:** `cd backend && uvicorn server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- **Root Directory:** (leave empty)

### 2. Railway Environment Variables:
Make sure all your variables are set in Railway dashboard:
- MONGO_URL
- DB_NAME  
- SECRET_KEY
- GMAIL_EMAIL
- GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

### 3. Redeploy:
After the environment variables are set, trigger a new deployment in Railway.

## Test URLs:
Once deployed, test these endpoints:
- `https://your-app.railway.app/auth/me` (should return "Not authenticated")
- `https://your-app.railway.app/api/` (should return API message)

The 404 errors should be resolved now!
